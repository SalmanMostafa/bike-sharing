I was exploring the bike sharing program data for the city of Los Angeles (LA) and the City of Philadelphia (PA). 

I focused my analysis on the effect of COVID-19 on the bike riding behavior in both cities before and during/after the quarantine 

The Most interesting findings were that the number of rides in LA decreased between q1 and q3, whereas the number increased in PA.

I looked at the ride durations, bike types and trip route to try to find out why the number decreased. Here is what I found:

	-The most frequent ride duration as a whole, before and after COVID-19, and in both cities is around 8 minutes. I suspect this 	represents a similar and frequent ride which sounds like a 	daily ride to work or school.

	-Despite the decrease in the number of rides, riders in LA have become a little more active preferring standard bikes over electric ones during/after quarantine. Philadelphia saw a 	significant increase of 50% in the number of electric bikes used during/after COVID-19. So, the increase in the number of rides in Philadelphia seems to come from new riders who are 		just trying riding bikes with an electric bike at first.  

	-Regarding the trip route, both cities saw an increase in the number of round trips and LA was always ahead of PA in the number of round trips.

These are the insights I extracted from the above analysis:

	1-LA and PA are using the bikes to drive to work or school.

	2-Most Individuals in LA were using bikes out of necesity or convenience. On the other hand, in PA, most people are biking regardless of having to go to work/school. They like the 		activity, hence the prominent use of standard bikes before and after COVID-19 and the increase in the number of riders.

	3-The second point could be an indicator of why the numbers decreased in LA. Most jobs became remote, so that removed the need for people to ride bikes.

	4-New/Existing Individuals became a little more active in LA during/after COVID-19 than in PA. The increase happened in the number of standard bikes in LA, and happened in 		electric bikes in PA.

	5- Both cities saw a big increase in the number of round trips but notice how the round-trip slice is bigger in LA.

	6- So, new individuals started riding during/after quarantine and/or some of the existing ones continued to ride but did round trips instead since they did not have to go to work as they 		used to.
	7- These two conclusions could be reasons why less people are riding bikes in LA 
 
After studying the above attributes, I concluded that the following factors may have contributed to the decrease in the number of rides in LA and their increase in PA:

	1- Work/School becomming remote lowered the incentive to ride bikes in LA since the main reason was to go to work/school

	2- Quarantine increased interest in excercise in both cities but more so in PA than in LA
